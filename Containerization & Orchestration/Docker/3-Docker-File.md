## What is a Dockerfile?

A **Dockerfile** is a simple text file containing instructions to create a Docker image. Docker images provide a consistent and reproducible environment for running applications in containers. By defining dependencies, configurations, and the operating system, Dockerfiles automate the image creation process, ensuring version-controlled and portable environments.

### Key Concepts:

- **Base Image**: The foundational layer of your image, typically an official operating system like Ubuntu, CentOS, or Alpine Linux.
- **Instructions**: Commands such as `RUN`, `COPY`, and `CMD` define what’s installed, how the image behaves, and which files to include.
  
  Common instructions include:
  - **`RUN`**: Executes commands (e.g., installing software) inside the container.
  - **`COPY`**: Copies files from your local machine to the image.
  - **`CMD`**: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Dockerfile

### 1. Create a File Named `Dockerfile`

Start by creating a file called `Dockerfile` in your project directory. If you name it something else, you'll need to specify the file name during the build process.

#### Example Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Add metadata such as version information
LABEL version="0.0.1"

# Update package lists and install essential tools
RUN apt update && apt install -y bash vim curl

# Install Nginx web server
RUN apt install -y nginx
```

#### Breakdown of Instructions:

- **`FROM ubuntu:22.04`**: Defines Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image.
- **`LABEL version="0.0.1"`**: Adds metadata, such as the version label.
- **`RUN`**: Runs commands inside the container. In this case, it updates package lists and installs `bash`, `vim`, `curl`, and `nginx`.

### 2. Example Using Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux is a lightweight option that results in smaller images. Here's an example of a Dockerfile using Alpine:

```dockerfile
# Use Alpine as the base image
FROM alpine

# Add version metadata
LABEL version="0.0.1"

# Update package lists and install essential tools
RUN apk update && apk add bash vim curl
```

This example is perfect for when you need a compact, minimalistic image.

### 3. Complex Dockerfile with a Script

In this example, you'll learn how to copy a script into the container, set a working directory, and make the script executable.

```dockerfile
# Start with Alpine as the base image
FROM alpine

# Add metadata
LABEL version="0.0.1"

# Update package lists and install essential tools
RUN apk update && apk add bash vim curl iputils-ping

# Copy the script into the image
COPY <local-file-path> <container-destination-path>

# Set the working directory for subsequent commands
WORKDIR <container-destination-path>

# Add environment variables
ENV API_KEY="123445"

# Set user and expose ports
USER deploy
EXPOSE 3210

# Give execution permissions to the script
RUN chmod +x app.sh

# Define the default command to run
CMD ["./app.sh"]
# Alternatively, you can use ENTRYPOINT
ENTRYPOINT ["bash", "./app.sh"]
```

#### Key Concepts in This Example:
- **`COPY`**: Copies a file from your local machine to the container.
- **`WORKDIR`**: Sets the working directory inside the container for subsequent commands.
- **`RUN chmod +x app.sh`**: Grants execution permissions to the `app.sh` script.
- **`CMD` vs. `ENTRYPOINT`**: `CMD` provides default behavior, while `ENTRYPOINT` is used when you want to ensure the container always runs a specific executable.

### 4. Build Your Docker Image

Once your `Dockerfile` is ready, build the Docker image using the `docker build` command.

```bash
docker build -t <app-name> <path-to-dockerfile>
```

#### Usage Examples:

- To build with a `Dockerfile` in the current directory:
  ```bash
  docker build -t app-test .
  ```
  Here, the `.` indicates the current directory as the build context.

- If your file is named something other than `Dockerfile` (e.g., `CustomDockerfile`):
  ```bash
  docker build -t app-test -f CustomDockerfile .
  ```

#### Explanation:
- **`docker build`**: Builds a Docker image.
- **`-t <app-name>`**: Tags the image with a name (e.g., `app-test`).
- **`<path-to-dockerfile>`**: Specifies the location of the `Dockerfile`. Use `.` for the current directory or provide an absolute path.

## Summary

A **Dockerfile** is a powerful tool for automating the creation of Docker images. Here’s a quick recap:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Use instructions like `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, and `CMD` to define the image.
2. **Build the Image**: Run the `docker build` command to turn your Dockerfile into a Docker image.
3. **Run the Container**: Once the image is built, use `docker run` to create and run a container based on it.
