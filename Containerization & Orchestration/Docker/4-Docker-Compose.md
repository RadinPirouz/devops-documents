# **Docker Compose Guide**

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to manage services, networks, and volumes using a YAML configuration file.

## **1. Basic Docker Compose Structure**

Before defining the services in Docker Compose, we need to specify the Docker Compose version and the services we want to run. Here's a basic YAML template:

```yaml
version: "<python-version>"  

services:
    <service-name>:  # The name of your service (e.g., web, db)
        container_name: <container-name>  # The name of the container
        image: <image-name>  # Docker image to be used for this service
        restart: always  # Ensure the container restarts if it stops or fails
        ports:
            - "<sv-port>:<container-port>"  # Map the host port to the container port
        volumes: 
            - <vol-name>:<container-loc>  # Attach a volume to a specific location in the container
        environment:
            - <env1>=<value1>  # Environment variables to be passed to the container
```

### **Explanation**:
- **`services:`**: The core section where you define different services (containers) that make up your application.
- **`<service-name>`**: Replace with the name of the service (e.g., `web`, `database`). Each service corresponds to a container.
- **`container_name`**: The name given to the container.
- **`image`**: The Docker image used to run the service (e.g., `python:3.9`, `nginx`).
- **`restart: always`**: Ensures the container will always restart if it stops, providing higher availability.
- **`ports`**: Maps ports from the host to the container, allowing the container to be accessed externally. The syntax is `<host-port>:<container-port>`.
- **`volumes`**: Links a Docker volume or host directory to a directory inside the container, enabling persistent data or sharing of resources. Example: `myvolume:/usr/src/app`.
- **`environment`**: Defines environment variables to be passed to the container at runtime. For example, setting an environment variable like `DB_HOST=localhost`.

## **2. Defining Volumes**

Docker Compose allows you to define persistent volumes that can be attached to containers. Here's how to define a volume:

```yaml
volumes:
    <vol-name>:  # Define the volume here
```

### **Explanation**:
- **`volumes:`**: This section allows you to define named volumes that can be used in the services.
- **`<vol-name>`**: Replace this with the name of the volume (e.g., `data-volume`, `db-volume`). The volume can be attached to different services to persist data beyond the container's lifecycle.

## **3. Useful Docker Compose Commands**

### **3.1 Start the Docker Compose Application**

To bring up the application defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, use:

```bash
docker compose up
```

### **3.2 Run Docker Compose in Detached Mode (Background)**

To run your Docker Compose services in the background (detached mode):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### **3.3 Stop and Remove Docker Compose Services**

To stop the services and remove the containers, networks, and volumes created by Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### **Explanation of Commands**:
- **`docker compose up`**: Builds, (re)creates, and starts all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **`docker compose up -d`**: Runs the services in the background, keeping your terminal free while the containers continue running.
- **`docker compose down`**: Stops and removes all running services, containers, and networks created by Docker Compose. You can add the `-v` flag to remove volumes as well.
