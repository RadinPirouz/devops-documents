# 🚦 **Traefik Overview**

**Traefik** is a **modern reverse proxy** and load balancer that makes deploying, securing, and managing microservices easier.

---

## 🔄 **Core Concepts**

### 1️⃣ **Entrypoint** 🛬

* The starting point for **incoming requests**.
* Example: `:80` for HTTP or `:443` for HTTPS.

### 2️⃣ **Router** 🚏

* Decides **where a request should go** based on rules.
* Connects **entrypoints** to **services**.

### 3️⃣ **Service** 🛠️

* The actual application or backend that processes the request.

## 🧩 **Routers Details**

**Routers** can have:

1. **Middleware** 🧱

   * Modify requests/responses before reaching the service.
   * Examples:

     * `StripPrefix` ➡️ Remove part of the URL path.
     * `RateLimit` ➡️ Limit request rate.
     * `Auth` ➡️ Add authentication.

2. **Rules** 📜

   * Define **how to match a request**.
   * Examples:

     * `Host("example.com")`
     * `PathPrefix("/api")`

## ⚙️ **Traefik Configuration Types**

1. **Static Configuration** 🗂️

   * Defines **Traefik’s own behavior**.
   * Example: entrypoints, providers, log level.
   * Set in `traefik.yml` or CLI args.

2. **Dynamic Configuration** 📡

   * Defines **how Traefik routes requests**.
   * Example: routers, services, middlewares.
   * Comes from files, Kubernetes CRDs, or Docker labels.
