# 📘 **Using the `wc` Command in Linux/Unix**

`wc` (word count) is a utility that counts lines, words, and bytes or characters in files. It’s useful for quickly getting file size details in text terms.

---

## ⚙️ Syntax

```bash
wc [option] file
```

---

## 🔎 Basic Usage

```bash
wc file
```

**Example output:**

```
 5  6 43 file1
```

This output means:

| Number | Meaning             |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| `5`    | Number of **lines** |
| `6`    | Number of **words** |
| `43`   | Number of **bytes** |

---

## 📋 Common Options

| Option | Description               | Example      |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| `-l`   | Count **lines** only      | `wc -l file` |
| `-w`   | Count **words** only      | `wc -w file` |
| `-c`   | Count **bytes** only      | `wc -c file` |
| `-m`   | Count **characters** only | `wc -m file` |

## 📌 Notes

* `bytes (-c)` counts raw bytes, which might differ from characters (`-m`) in multibyte encodings like UTF-8.
* Without options, `wc` outputs lines, words, and bytes by default.
