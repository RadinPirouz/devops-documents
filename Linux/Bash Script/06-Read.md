# üìù Bash `read` Command

The `read` command in **Bash** is used to **take user input** from the terminal. It stores the input into one or more **variables**.

---

## üî§ Basic Syntax

```bash
read [options] variable
```

---

## üìò Simple Example

```bash
echo "What is your name?"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

* `read name` takes input from the user and stores it in the variable `name`.
* The script then greets the user with the stored input.

---

## üéØ Prompt Inline with `-p`

```bash
read -p "What is your name? " name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

* `-p` allows you to show the prompt **on the same line** as the user input.

---

## üîí Silent Input with `-s` (e.g., Passwords)

```bash
read -sp "Enter your password: " password
echo $password >> pass.txt
```

* `-s` hides the user‚Äôs input while typing (useful for passwords).
* `>> pass.txt` appends the password to a file (‚ö†Ô∏è For demonstration only‚Äî**avoid storing passwords in plain text**!).

---

## ‚è≥ Set a Timeout with `-t`

```bash
read -t 5 -p "Enter something in 5 seconds: " data
```

* `-t 5` gives the user **5 seconds** to input something.
* If no input is given in time, the script moves on.
