# ⏳ Kubernetes Jobs

A **Job** in Kubernetes runs a pod to completion. It ensures that a specified number of pods successfully terminate.

Use Jobs for **batch processing**, **one-off tasks**, or **short-lived workloads**.

## 🧾 Example Job Manifest

Here’s a minimal example of a Job that runs a simple `echo` command:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: myjob
  namespace: ns
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: job1
          image: alpine
          command:
            - echo 
            - "hello world"
      restartPolicy: Never
```

> 💡 **Note:** Always set `restartPolicy` to `Never` or `OnFailure` for jobs.
> 📌 Jobs are useful for tasks like backups, report generation, or database migrations.
